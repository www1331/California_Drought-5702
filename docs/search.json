    "text": "1 Introduction\nWhen I first came to the U.S. I heard the older man next to me on the plane talking to me about the drought in California, but at the time I knew very little about the specifics. So this time I like to choose this topic to help myself and others to know more about the drought in California.\nIn searching for data, I found more significance to this topic. California’s history is closely tied to its environmental conditions, including drought. Examining this topic provides historical context to help us understand how past events have influenced current policies and societal attitudes toward water use and conservation. In addition, California’s drought is a good example to familiarize us with a more visual and scientific approach to understanding global environmental issues and climate change.\nThrough this program we hope to answer the following key questions: How have drought conditions in California changed over time? What are the current trends? How have these drought conditions affected different counties in California? What are the economic costs associated with these droughts, particularly in terms of agricultural losses and disaster management? How can data on drought conditions inform decision-making and individual action plans?"

    "text": "2.1 Description\nFirst of all we are interested in the specifics of the California drought, we want to know over what period of time the drought conditions have actually gotten severe and what the trend in the drought conditions has been, and that trend and that detail we can get from the first dataset. Secondly we are also interested in the drought conditions in individual counties within California, we would like to know which counties have the most severe drought conditions and if there is any specific link between drought duration and geographic location, and this information can be obtained from the second dataset. After analyzing the specifics of the drought, we wanted to learn more about the impacts caused by the drought. We plan to extract drought-related data from the overall natural disaster data and analyze the economic losses and tens of thousands of people caused by the drought, which is something the third dataset can help us with."

(The aggregated missing patterns in 3 dataset are same and we just show one of them)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "After finishing analyzing the data in three different directions, I have a general answer to a couple of questions I envisioned at the beginning. California’s drought levels have not been an improving trend over time. Different counties are experiencing different levels of drought, but overall they are at very dry levels. The economic damage caused by drought is very severe and is the most damaging of all natural disasters in California, so it is very necessary to put a lot of effort into studying and dealing with drought. Much of the limitations we encountered in our research stemmed from a lack of relevant expertise; we found a wealth of resources and data but it was not clear how to categorize and distill a range of data in order to support a clear direction for our research, which I think requires a certain amount of specific knowledge of geography and meteorological law. Our future direction lies in the questions that we still haven’t solved, the more detailed questions, such as what is the share of agricultural losses in terms of damage caused, and what are the links between the two."
